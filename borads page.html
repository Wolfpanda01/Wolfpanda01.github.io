    <p>My objectives for the Robotics and Embedded System major are:   </p>
       
    <ol><li> Design and complete robotic and embedded systems solutions that apply to real-world situations and challenges.
        <div>I picked my final from C++ and 7 segment display. The game takes user inputs and changes the dialogue options based on the user’s input. The seven-segment display takes the user inputs on button changes it to binary and can display what the user wants. </div>

        <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiXDQNvluHs">7 segment display</a>
        <li> Implement a simple microprocessor using digital logic design.</li>
        <div>I picked my M5stickCplus project and the 4-bit adder project. </div>
            <div>The Firebase project uses user input and control over a led with an on/off system.</div> 
            <div>The 4-bit adder project is a project that takes the users input and gives them what the binary number is remaining.</div>

           <a href="https://youtu.be/loP6OCB_j78">4-bit adder </a> 
        <li> Demonstrate embedded system design skills, including, but not limited to, microcontroller selection, schematic design,
        printed circuit board layout, design for electromagnetic compatibility and design for manufacturing.</li>
        <div>I picked the chained led project and perfboard assignment.</div><div> I picked a clean schematic that is easy to be copied.</div> 
        <div>The perfboard show how I can make a simple circuit in a very small section of a perfboard.</div>
        <div><img src="led.png"></div>
        <div><img src="perfboard.PNG"></div>
        <li> Apply knowledge of transducers, actuators and simultaneous hardware and software development in the design of an
        embedded system.</li>
        <div>I picked the RC oscillator and IR senser.</div> 
            <div>The IR sensor adds different button presses till the correct code it input in.</div> 
            <div>The RC oscillator has LEDs go back and forth in a pattern due to the BJT.</div>

        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/P03jl6_-Hvk ">IR senser</a>
        <div><img src="ir senser.png"></div>
        <li> Design and analyze real-time embedded systems, including advanced digital logic design, signal processing and highspeed digital systems.</li>
        <div>I picked my final for C++ and 7 segment display.</div>
        <div>  The 7 seven segment display uses Arduino code to process button presses into binary and changes it to a number or letter depending on the bit.</div>
        <div> The C++ final uses code to calculate damage, pointers, uses classes.</div>

        <a href=" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BiXDQNvluHs">7 segment display</a>
        <li> Implement and evaluate algorithms and methods enabling autonomy in a mobile robot.</li></ol>
        <div>I put my boar project and wheel encoder project.</div>
            <div> The wheel encoder drive a robot around in a simple way with directions given in the code.</div>
            <div> The boar project is a project were servo control the angle of the boars’ legs to enable a boar robot to walk.</div>

        <p>My objectives for the 3D maker and Fabrication major are: </p>
<ol><li> Demonstrate the ability to prototype, build, and apply for patents for technology products meeting specific human factors, forms and function criteria
        <div>I picked a book holder and model stand.</div>
            <div>These were two project that met my client’s expectations and were prototyped multiple times.</div> 
            <div>They both are extremely function and when though different test.</div>
        <div><img src="bookholder.jpg"></div>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/XamIid94L34">Water Test</a>
        <div><img src="thing.jpg"></div>
        <li>Demonstrate the ability to evaluate trends in design principles and apply them into the form and function of devices</li>
        <div>I picked a brace and prototype of the book holder. </div>
        <div>For the book holder, I used triangles and poles as a way to save on materials and keep strength.</div>
          <div> The trend I followed for the brace was the ability to wear an object in a brace form with a tying mechanism.</div>
        <div><img src="brace.png"></div>
        <div><img src="propro.png"></div>
        <li>Demonstrate the ability to evaluate material and build technique options during the creation of products and their prototypes </li>
        <div>I picked two materials I’ve tested. 
            <div>These were in a test showing the strength of different materials that could be used in the lining of a game console game case.</div>  
          <div>In the case face PLA was the winner in the test proving its durability.</div>
        <div><img src="almu.jpg"></div>
        <div><img src="pla.jpg"></div>
        <li> Demonstrate the ability to evaluate and implement developments within electromechanical,algrithmic,robotic, microprocessor, sensor and other advancing technology areas while making product design decisions</li>
        <div>I picked a model stand that can have LEDs put under it and my M5stickplus case. </div>
            <div> The M5stickplus case was made to hold the tiny microprocessor safely.</div>
                <div>The model stand was made for displaying models with LEDs under to light from the bottom.</div>
        <div><img src="leddes.PNG"></div>
        <div><img src="partsholder.PNG"></div>
        <li>Demonstrate the ability to work within a maker studio environment to design, build, test and revise products that neet client timeline, design and quality requirements</li>
        <div>I picked my drone and an old part of murphy.</div>
        <div> I made both of those using the maker’s space equipment and resources.</div>
        <div>The murphy part was a test of making a parts holder that worked with our needs.</div>
       <div><img src="drone.jpg"></div>
        <div><img src="part.jpg"></div>
        <a href="https://github.com/Wolfpanda01/drone-web-page">https://github.com/Wolfpanda01/drone-web-page </a>
        <li>Demonstrate proficiency with industry accepted prototyping, modeling, build and maker tool and techniques</li></ol>
        <div>I picked the model stand and the model of the book holder.</div>
            <div>  I picked this two because they show that have the ability to use different software to model parts.</div>
         <div> That is mostly shown in the book holder model. </div>
