        <div>I'm Robotics and 3D maker and Fabrication student that love to help animals.
            I've got two dogs which helped fueled my sip project Calming Pets. </div>
            <div>I love scince and art. I never give up even when my ADHD gets in my way. </div>
            <div>Community Stament</div>
            <div>My story originally starts in high school where I found my love of robotics and fabrication. I’ve grown a lot, while being at UAT and hope to use that knowledge to make products that I know will help the people and the world. Something that I did while being here was plan on making a robotic boar to help track wild boars that wander into the city. I would try to help my fellow engineers try to solve problems they can see just like I have before. My main goal has always been to help people in any capacity that I can.  
                There have been many people at the school that have shaped me to be the engineer I am today. Some of them being my professors but I would say my friend really help shape me because we helped each other learn and grow. While I may struggle at time, One thing that I have that many don’t is I won’t give up. If you asked me what my value is I can’t tell you because it changes depending on how my ADHD wants to play but despite that I strive to get done what I can when I’m not being stopped. There are many things that I’ve done like make a working servo leg movement for the boar and build my own website for boards and sip.  While they aren’t the ones that I can say that prepared me the most they are they ones that showed me I can do a lot more then I think I can. They showed me that I can make a difference in the world if I give it my all.  
            I’ve learned so much from readings on different parts and how things work like how blue LEDs are hard to make. One of my goals is to teach someone how cool robotics can be, it would be nice to be able to be seen but that’s not what I care about. I want to make the community grow and see more female engineers join me in the workplace. 
            There is a lot to know about me, but there is also so much I want to do for the world. While I may only be one person, I know that I can make a difference if I try. I’ve made my mistakes and had successes too, but I want to strive to make the world better one person at a time. Even if I can help only one person that would make me feel like I’ve helped the community in a small way. While I’ve still got a lot to learn I hope that I may overcome the obstacles that stand forever in my way.</div>
